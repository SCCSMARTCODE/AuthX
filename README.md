### Project Name
**AuthX**

### Project Description
**AuthX** is a versatile and reusable authentication API built to work seamlessly with both Flask and FastAPI. It supports multiple authentication methods, including traditional username/password login, OAuth 2.0 with social logins (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.), two-factor authentication (2FA), passwordless login, and more. AuthX is designed with security and flexibility in mind, making it easy to integrate into various applications while providing robust user management and role-based access control (RBAC).

# AuthX

**AuthX** is a reusable and modular authentication API designed to work with both Flask and FastAPI. It offers a wide range of authentication methods, making it an ideal solution for projects that require secure and flexible user authentication.

## Features

- **Username/Password Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with hashed passwords.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Support for social logins with Google, Facebook, GitHub, and more.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional second layer of security with OTP via SMS or email.
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Magic link or email link login for a seamless user experience.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for stateless sessions.
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure service-to-service communication using API keys.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User roles and permissions management.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Support for enterprise-level SSO with protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or customize the API to fit your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [OAuthlib](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authx.git
   cd authx
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your configuration. Example:
   ```env
   FLASK_APP=authx_flask
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///authx.db
   ```

5. Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

### Usage

#### Flask Implementation

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. Explore the available endpoints and start integrating AuthX into your Flask-based project.

#### FastAPI Implementation

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn authx_fastapi:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2. Explore the available endpoints via the automatically generated Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Authentication Methods

- **Username/Password**: Register and log in users with traditional credentials.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Enable social logins with popular providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
- **2FA**: Add an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication.
- **Passwordless**: Allow users to log in without a password using a magic link.
- **JWT**: Secure API requests with token-based authentication.
- **API Key**: Protect your services with API key-based authentication.

### Configuration

You can configure various aspects of AuthX by editing the `.env` file. Key configuration options include:

- **Database URI**: Specify the database connection string.
- **Secret Key**: Set the secret key for secure session management.
- **OAuth Providers**: Configure credentials for OAuth providers.
